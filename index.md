## Introduction

Emerging mobile applications such as ultra-high-definition (UHD) video streaming, AR/VR, and cloud gaming require accessing diverse hardware such as video codecs, cameras, and image processors. However, today's mobile emulators exhibit poor performance when emulating these *high-throughput* hardware devices. 
We pinpoint the major reason to be the discrepancy between
the guest and host's memory architecture for hardware devices, *i.e.*, 
the mobile guest's centralized memory on 
system-on-chip (SoC) versus the PC/server's separated memory modules on individual hardware. Such a discrepancy makes 
the shared virtual memory (SVM) architecture of mobile emulators highly inefficient.

To address this,
we design and implement vSoC, a first-of-its-kind virtual mobile SoC
that enables virtual devices to efficiently share data through a *unified* SVM framework for virtual devices.
We then build upon the SVM framework a novel prefetch engine that 
effectively hides the overhead of coherence maintenance (which guarantees devices sharing
the same virtual memory see the same data), a performance bottleneck in traditional emulators.
We implement vSoC for two mobile OSes (Android and OpenHarmony).
Extensive evaluations show that vSoC achieves significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art emulators:
1.7-4.6Ã— frame rates and 35%-62% lower motion-to-photon latency for various multimedia applications.
vSoC is adopted by the emulator of a major commercial mobile IDE.


## Open Source Progress

Currently, we are scrutinizing our codebase for security concerns and following internal procedures for open sourcing code.
We expect the relevant code and data to be released soon.
