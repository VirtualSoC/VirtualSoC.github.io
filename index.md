## Introduction

Emerging mobile applications such as ultra-high-definition (UHD) video streaming, AR/VR, and cloud gaming require accessing diverse hardware such as video codecs, cameras, and image processors. However, today's mobile emulators exhibit poor performance when emulating these *high-throughput* hardware devices. 
We pinpoint the major reason to be the discrepancy between
the guest and host's memory architecture for hardware devices, *i.e.*, 
the mobile guest's centralized memory on 
system-on-chip (SoC) versus the PC/server's separated memory modules on individual hardware. Such a discrepancy makes 
the shared virtual memory (SVM) architecture of mobile emulators highly inefficient.

To address this,
we design and implement vSoC, a first-of-its-kind virtual mobile SoC
that enables virtual devices to efficiently share data through a *unified* SVM framework for virtual devices.
We then build upon the SVM framework a novel prefetch engine that 
effectively hides the overhead of coherence maintenance (which guarantees devices sharing
the same virtual memory see the same data), a performance bottleneck in traditional emulators.
We implement vSoC for two mobile OSes (Android and OpenHarmony).
Extensive evaluations show that vSoC achieves significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art emulators:
1.7-4.6Ã— frame rates and 35%-62% lower motion-to-photon latency for various multimedia applications.
vSoC is adopted by the emulator of a major commercial mobile IDE.


## Open Source Progress

**Update 2024.7.3**: we have obtained permission to release vSoC source code. Since vSoC includes both guest and host-side implementations and involves tens of repositories, we are still organizing our codebase to facilitate building. We have also begun writing documentation, e.g., [build instructions](build.md).

Currently, we are scrutinizing our codebase for security concerns and following internal procedures for open sourcing code.
We expect the relevant code and data to be released soon.
